BigBuffers
===========
![I like bug buffers](./docs/images/i-like-big-buffers-and-i-cannot-lie.jpg) 

**BigBuffers** is a fork of **FlatBuffers**, a cross platform serialization library architected for maximum memory efficiency. **BigBuffers** supports buffers >2Gb by using a 64-bit index instead of 32-bit.  Both projects allow you to directly access serialized data without parsing/unpacking it first, while still having great forwards/backwards compatibility but they are not wire-compatible.
