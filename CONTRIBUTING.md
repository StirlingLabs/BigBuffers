# Contributing

Want to contribute? Great! First, read this page.

## Before you contribute

- Any code that you submit is contributed under the license of the repo, 
  so please familiarise yourself with that license and be sure that you're 
  happy to contribute under these terms.
- Don't contribute code that infringes on other people's patents or copyrights 
  and make sure that you tell us if you become aware that you have. 
- Before you start working on a larger contribution, it's a good idea to get in 
  touch with us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can 
  help out and possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to 
  avoid frustration later on.

## Code reviews
All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use Github pull requests for this purpose.

Some tips for good pull requests:
- Use the 
  [code style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
  When in doubt, try to stay true to the existing code of the project.
- Write a descriptive commit message. What problem are you solving and what
  are the consequences? Where and what did you test? Some good tips:
  [here](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message)
  and [here](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SubmittingPatches).
- If your PR consists of multiple commits which are successive improvements /
  fixes to your first commit, consider squashing them into a single commit
  (`git rebase -i`) such that your PR is a single commit on top of the current
  HEAD. This make reviewing the code so much easier, and our history more
  readable.
